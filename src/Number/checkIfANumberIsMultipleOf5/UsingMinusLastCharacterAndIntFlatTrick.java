Question: Check if a number is multiple of 5 without using / and % operators
Source: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/check-if-a-number-is-multiple-of-5-without-using-and-operators/

Algorithm: 

METHOD 1 (Repeatedly subtract 5 from n) 
Run a loop and subtract 5 from n in the loop while n is greater than 0. After the loop terminates, 
check whether n is 0. If n becomes 0 then n is multiple of 5, otherwise not.

METHOD 2 (Convert to string and check the last character) 
Convert n to a string and check the last character of the string. If the last character is ‘5’ or ‘0’ 
then n is multiple of 5, otherwise not.

Method 3 (Set last digit as 0 and use floating point trick)  // BEST ALGORITHM
A number n can be a mulpile of 5 in two cases. When last digit of n is 5 or 0. If last bit in binary equivalent
of n is set (which can be the case when last digit is 5) then we multiply by 2 using n<<1 to make sure that if 
the number is multpile of 5 then we have the last digit as 0. Once we do that, our work is to just check if the
last digit is 0 or not, which we can do using float and integer comparison trick.

		In the above ascii table, we can see that 0 to 9 are represented from 48 to 57
