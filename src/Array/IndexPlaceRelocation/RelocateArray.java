Question: WAP to modify the array such that arr[I] = arr[arr[I]]. 
DO THIS IN PLACE i.e. with out using additional memory. 

example : if a = {2,3,1,0} 
o/p: a = {1,0,3,2} 

NOTE : THE ARRAY CONTAINS 0 TO N-1 INTEGERS.

 * ALGORITHM: 
 * 
 * What we are doing is effectively magnifying the final result so that the current 
 * value doesn't matter anymore. When we multiply the arr[arr[i]] by size and add the current value to it,
 * you get a new value. This new value can use division to get the final result or modulo to obtain the 
 * current value. When he does the division, the current value(remainder) just falls off and you get the 
 * final value.


For General Understanding, understand this:
(x + y*z)/z = y    provided x and y is less than z. (IN SHORT USE / TO GET THE OTHER VALUE)
(x + y*z)%z = x    provided x and y is less than z. (IN SHORT USE % TO GET THE CURRENT VALUE)
This is the concept used here.
Example:
(3 + 4*5)/5 = 4
(3 + 4*5)%5 = 3

arr[i] = arr[i] + arr[arr[i]]*size
so arr[i]/size = arr[arr[i]]

In the code you see the author has used % below; this is done just to make sure arr[i] and arr[arr[i]] 
is less than size as explained earlier.
arr[i] += (arr[arr[i]]%size)*size;
