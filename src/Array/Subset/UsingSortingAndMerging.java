Question: Find whether FIRST array is subset of SECOND array (Asked in Facebook Interview)
Question and Answer Source: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-whether-an-array-is-subset-of-another-array-set-1/

Algoritm:
	I. USING HASHSET
	NOTE: DOES NOT HANDLE DUPLICATES
	1) Create a Hash Table for all the elements of arr1[].
	2) Traverse arr2[] and search for each element of arr2[] in the Hash Table. 
	If element is not found then return 0.
	3) If all elements are found then return 1.
		
	II. USING SORTING AND BINARY SEARCH
	NOTE: DOES NOT HANDLE DUPLICATES
	1) Sort arr1[] O(mLogm)
	2) For each element of arr2[], do binary search for it in sorted arr1[].
	         a) If the element is not found then return 0.
	3) If all elements are present then return 1.
			
	III. Using Sorting and Merging
	(METHOD WHICH HANDLES DUPLICATES)
	1) Sort both arrays: arr1[] and arr2[] O(mLogm + nLogn)
	2) Use Merge type of process to see if all elements of sorted arr2[] are present in sorted arr1[]
			
	Note that method 1 and method 2 donâ€™t handle the cases when we have duplicates in arr2[]. 
	For example, {1, 4, 4, 2} is not a subset of {1, 4, 2}, but these methods will print it as a subset.
	
	THUS, the third method should be used which handles DUPLICATES
	
	TODO:
	IV. Using HashMap (BEST METHOD WHICH HANDLES DUPLICATES)
	key = integer and value = count of repetition (used in case of duplicates)
	Store the big array in HashMap
	Iterate through the smallArray and for every element check whether map.get(small[i]) >=1
	Also for every hit, decrement the value in map
	If, map.get(small[i]) is NOT >=1 OR map does not contain small[i] then return false
	
	 NOTE: This handles duplicates and is O(n) time and O(n) space algorithm where n = length of big array

	 * Analysis:
	 * Time Complexity = O(mlgm + nlgn) where m = length of FIRST array and n = length of SECOND array
	 * Space Complexity = O(1)

/*
NOTE: You can implement the remaining algorithms but they are NOT full proof.
They dont handle the case where the first array contains duplicates
For example, {1, 4, 4, 2} is not a subset of {1, 4, 2}, but implementing method I and method II 
will print true saying that it as a subset whereas it is not.
	
THUS, although time complexity is O(mlgm + nlgn), METHOD III of SortingAndMerging is the BEST.
