Question: Find whether FIRST array is subset of SECOND array (Asked in Facebook Interview)
Question and Answer Source: http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-whether-an-array-is-subset-of-another-array-set-1/

Algoritm:
    METHOD I. Using HashMap 
    (BEST METHOD WHICH HANDLES DUPLICATES)
	1. Program is to check whether FIRST array is subset of SECOND array so we will HashMap the second array
	   where key = element and value = repetition count
	2. Iterate through a1 array and check whether the element exists in map
	   2.1. If the element is not present in map then return false
	   2.2. If the element is present but is not repeated as it is repeated in the a1 array
	   2.3. If the element is present and repeated then decrement its repetition count in HashMap
	3. All checks are done so return true
	 * Analysis:
	 * Time Complexity = O(m+n) where m = length of FIRST ARRAY and n = length of SECOND ARRAY
	 * Space Complexity = O(n) where n = length of SECOND ARRAY
	 
	
	METHOD II. Using Sorting and Merging
	(METHOD WHICH HANDLES DUPLICATES)
	1) Sort both arrays: arr1[] and arr2[] O(mLogm + nLogn)
	2) Use Merge type of process to see if all elements of sorted arr2[] are present in sorted arr1[]
			
	Note that method 1 and method 2 donâ€™t handle the cases when we have duplicates in arr2[]. 
	For example, {1, 4, 4, 2} is not a subset of {1, 4, 2}, but these methods will print it as a subset.
	
	THUS, the third method should be used which handles DUPLICATES
	 * Analysis:
	 * Time Complexity = O(mlgm + nlgn) where m = length of FIRST ARRAY and n = length of SECOND ARRAY
	 * Space Complexity = O(1)
	 
	 
	 
	METHOD III. USING HASHSET
	NOTE: DOES NOT HANDLE DUPLICATES
	1) Create a Hash Table for all the elements of arr1[].
	2) Traverse arr2[] and search for each element of arr2[] in the Hash Table. 
	If element is not found then return 0.
	3) If all elements are found then return 1.
		
	METHOD IV. USING SORTING AND BINARY SEARCH
	NOTE: DOES NOT HANDLE DUPLICATES
	1) Sort arr1[] O(mLogm)
	2) For each element of arr2[], do binary search for it in sorted arr1[].
	         a) If the element is not found then return 0.
	3) If all elements are present then return 1.

NOTE: You can implement the remaining algorithms but they are NOT full proof.
They dont handle the case where the first array contains duplicates
For example, {1, 4, 4, 2} is not a subset of {1, 4, 2}, but implementing method I and method II 
will print true saying that it as a subset whereas it is not.
	
THUS, although time complexity is O(mlgm + nlgn), METHOD III of SortingAndMerging is the BEST.
