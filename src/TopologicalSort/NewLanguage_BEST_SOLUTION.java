 * Question: There's a new language which uses the Latin alphabet. However, you don't know the order among letters. 

It could be: 
a b c d ... 

As it could also be: 
b e z a m i ... 

You receive a list of words lexicographically sorted by the rules of this new language. From this list, 
derive one valid particular ordering of letters in this language.

 * 									OR
 * 
 * 
 * 	Given a function 

	getRandomTripplet() 

	which returns a random triplet of letters from a string. You don't
	know the string using calls to this function you have to correctly guess the string. 
	The length of the string is also given. 

	Lets say the string is helloworld the function getRandomTriplet will return things like 

	hlo 
	hew 
	wld 
	owo 

	the function maintains the relative order of the letters. so it will never return

	ohl since h is before o in the string. 
	owe since w is after e 

	The string is not known you are only given length of the string.

 * 
 * Algorithm:
 * The idea is to create a graph of characters and then find topological sorting of the created graph. 
 * Following are the detailed steps.

1) Create a graph g with number of vertices equal to the size of alphabet in the given alien language. 
For example, if the alphabet size is 5, then there can be 5 characters in words. Initially there are no 
edges in graph.

2) Do following for every pair of adjacent words in given sorted array.
   a) Let the current pair of words be word1 and word2. One by one compare characters of both words and 
	  find the first mismatching characters.
   b) Create an edge in g from mismatching character of word1 to that of word2.

3) Print topological sorting of the above created graph.

/*
Analysis:

n = total number of words
totalCharacters = Average length of each word from the list of words

Time Complexity: The first step to create a graph takes O(n + totalCharacters) time where n is number 
of given words and totalCharacters is average length of each word from the list of words. 
The second step is also topological sorting. 
Note that there would be alpha vertices and at-most (n-1) edges in the graph. 
The time complexity of topological sorting is O(V+E) which is O(n + totalCharacters) here. So overall time complexity 
is O(n + totalCharacters) + O(n + totalCharacters) which is O(n + totalCharacters).

Space Complexity = O(|V|+|E|)
