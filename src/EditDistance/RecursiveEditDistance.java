	Analysis:
		I. Time Complexity:  O(3^(m+n-1)). This is an EXPONENTIAL time algorithm
		
		The recursion formula is,

		T(m,n) = T(m-1,n-1) + T(m-1,n) + T(m,n-1) + 1
		T(0,n) = n
		T(m,0) = m
		is right.

		You can see, that every T(m,n) splits of into three paths. Due to every node runs in O(1) we only have to 
		count the nodes.

		A shortest path has the length min(m,n), so the (recursion)tree has at least 3min(m,n) nodes. But there are 
		some paths that are longer. 
		
		You get the longest path by alternately reduce the first and the second string.
		This path will have the length m+n-1, so the whole tree has at most 3m+n-1 nodes.

		Let m = min(m,n). The tree contains also at least

		enter image description here

		different paths, one for each possible order of reducing n.

		So Ω(2^(max(m,n))) and Ω(3^(min(m,n))) are lower bounds and O(3^(m+n-1)) is an upper bound.
		
		*
		*I. Space Complexity: The space complexity of the algorithm is also EXPONENTIAL (since multiple
		* recursive calls utilizes many stack frames. If the length of the strings is 10^5, the program might crash)
