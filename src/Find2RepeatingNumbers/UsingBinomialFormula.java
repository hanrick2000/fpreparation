/* FIND THE TWO REPEATING NUMBERS:
 * 
 * Question: We are given an array of length n+2 where n numbers are non-repeating BUT 2 numbers
 * repeat themselves. We need to find the 2 repeating numbers.

Solution:
1. Using XOR :	Time Complexity = O(n), Space Complexity = O(1)
NOTE: This method is applicable ONLY for 2 Repeating numbers and NOT for n Repeating numbers.
2. Using HashMap : Time Complexity = O(n), Space Complexity = O(n)
NOTE: This method is applicable for not just 2 Repeating numbers but for n Repeating numbers.
3. Using Sorting: Time Complexity = O(nlgn), Space Complexity = O(1)
NOTE: This method is applicable for not just 2 Repeating numbers but for n Repeating numbers.
4. Using Count Array:Time Complexity = O(n), Space Complexity = O(n)
NOTE: This method is applicable for not just 2 Repeating numbers but for n Repeating numbers.
5. Using Binomial Formula: Time Complexity = O(n), Space Complexity = O(1)
NOTE: This method is applicable ONLY for 2 Repeating numbers and NOT for n Repeating numbers.
6. Using ArrayElementInverse: Time Complexity = O(n), Space Complexity = O(1)
NOTE: This method is applicable for not just 2 Repeating numbers but for n Repeating numbers.
