/*
Question: We are given a set of integers with repeated occurences of elements.
For Example, S={1,2,2}. 
We need to print the power set of S ensuring that the repeated elements of the power
set are printed only once. 
For the above S, the power set will be 
{NULL, {1}, {2}, {2}, {1,2}, {1,2}, {2,2}, {1,2,2}}. 
So, as per the question requirements, we need to print 
{NULL, {1}, {2}, {1,2}, {2,2}, {1,2,2}}
